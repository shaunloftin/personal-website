# shaunloftin.com
personal-website is the GitHub repository for my personal website: [shaunloftin.com](http://shaunloftin.com).

This website has been adapted and redesigned throughout the years. The most recent version is adapted from a [Bootstrap 4 template](https://bootstrapmade.com/free-html-bootstrap-template-my-resume/) with personal HTML, CSS, SCSS, and JS additions. 


## Usage Permissions
All of the images, portfolio content, and copy used throughout the website are strictly copyrighted by Shaun Loftin. None of the images, portfolio content, copy, or any other non-template additions can be used without explicit permission.

I do not own this Bootstrap template nor can I provide permission for it's use. Please refer to the [template website](https://bootstrapmade.com/free-html-bootstrap-template-my-resume/) for specific licensing details.

I do not own the landing section graph animation. This animation has been modified using the particles.js library [found here](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/). Refer to this repository for specific, up-to-date licensing information.
